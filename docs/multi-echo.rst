Multi-echo fMRI
===============
In multi-echo (ME) fMRI, data are acquired for multiple echo times, resulting in
multiple time series for each voxel.

The physics of multi-echo fMRI
------------------------------
Multi-echo fMRI data is obtained by acquiring multiple TEs (commonly called
`echo times`_) for each MRI volume
during data collection.
While fMRI signal contains important neural information (termed the blood
oxygen-level dependent, or `BOLD signal`_,
it also contains "noise" (termed non-BOLD signal) caused by things like
participant motion and changes in breathing.
Because the BOLD signal is known to decay at a set rate, collecting multiple
echos allows us to assess whether components of the fMRI signal are BOLD- or
non-BOLD.
For a comprehensive review, see `Kundu et al. (2017)`_.

Why use multi-echo?
-------------------
ME-EPI exhibits higher SNR and improves statistical power of analyses.

Acquisition Parameter Recommendations
************************************
There is no empirically tested best parameter set for multi-echo acquisition.
The guidelines for optimizing parameters are similar to single-echo fMRI.
For multi-echo fMRI, the same factors that may guide priorities for single echo
fMRI sequence are also relevant. Choose sequence parameters that meet the
priorities of a study with regards to spatial resolution, spatial coverage,
sample rate, signal-to-noise ratio, signal drop-out, distortion, and artifacts.

The one difference with multi-echo is a slight time cost. For multi-echo fMRI,
the shortest echo time (TE) is essentially free since it is collected in the
gap between the radio frequency (RF) pulse and the single-echo acquisition.
The second echo tends to roughly match the single-echo TE.
Additional echoes require more time. For example, on a 3T MRI, if the
T2* weighted TE is 30ms for single echo fMRI, a multi-echo sequence may
have TEs of 15.4, 29.7, and 44.0ms. In this example, the extra 14ms of
acquisition time per RF pulse is the cost of multi-echo fMRI.

One way to think about this cost is in comparison to single-echo fMRI.
If a multi-echo sequence has identical spatial resolution and acceleration as
a single-echo sequence, then a rough rule of thumb is that the multi-echo
sequence will have 10% fewer slices or 10% longer TR. Instead of compromising
on slice coverage or TR, one can increase acceleration. If one increases
acceleration, it is worth doing an empirical comparison to make sure there
isn't a non-trivial loss in SNR or an increase of artifacts.

A minimum of 3 echoes is recommended for running TE-dependent denoising.
While there are successful studies that donâ€™t follow this rule, it may be useful
to have at least one echo that is earlier and one echo that is later than the
TE one would use for single-echo T2* weighted fMRI.

More than 3 echoes may be useful, because that would allow for more accurate
estimates of BOLD and non-BOLD weighted fluctuations, but more echoes have an
additional time cost, which would result in either less spatiotemporal coverage
or more acceleration. Where the benefits of more echoes balance out the additional
costs is an open research question.

We are not recommending specific parameter options at this time. There are
multiple ways to balance the slight time cost from the added echoes that have
resulted in research publications. We suggest new multi-echo fMRI users examine
the `spreadsheet`_ of journal articles that use multi-echo fMRI to identify
studies with similar acquisition priorities, and use the parameters from those
studies as a starting point.
